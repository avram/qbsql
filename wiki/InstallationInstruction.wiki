#summary How to install and use `qbsql`

= Installation =
  # Download the code from the Downloads section and unzip it somewhere accessible by your webserver. For the most up-to-date, but possibly less well-tested, code, see the "Sources" tab on the project page.
  # Edit the file `functions.php` as necessary. For now, the important thing is `$mysql_prefix`. Set it to something short that will represent this tournament. For example, for an intramural tournament, you might choose `im2008`. Also set the appropriate variables to match your MySQL configuration.
  # Edit the file `structure.sql`, changing each instance of `im1` in the file (like `im1_players`) to the prefix you chose in step 2 (i.e., `im2008_players`). Use your text editor's find and replace function.
  # Import `structure.sql` into your MySQL database, using a command like:
{{{
mysql -u my_username -p my_password my_database < structure.sql
}}}
  # You should be ready to go. Pull up the page `index.php` in your web browser. Enter the username and password from `functions.php` into the two boxes and you can start running the tournament!
