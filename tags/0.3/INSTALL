** Introduction               **
********************************

This is a project to develop a good online stats program for running quizbowl tournaments.

It works effectively, but it still requires some technical knowledge.

If you have questions or want to help out, see the project page for information:
http://code.google.com/p/qbsql/

Cool things you can do with qbsql:

    * Upload round results from multiple locations
    * Show live-updating results
    * Do stats without a Windows machine 

Where we're going:

This is a project that could use some work. If you like to code and like to play quiz bowl, this could use some improvements, like:

    * A way to cleanly export a tournament and make its results static
    * Something like a round-robin and bracket generator, so that qbsql could know what matches should be played, and to make tournament directors' lives easier.
    * Probably lots more!

** How to install and use qbsql **
