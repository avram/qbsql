** Introduction               **
********************************

This is a project to develop a good online stats program for running quizbowl tournaments.

It works effectively, but it still requires some technical knowledge.

If you have questions or want to help out, email ajlyon+qbsql@gmail.com .

Cool things you can do with qbsql:

    * Upload round results from multiple locations
    * Show live-updating results
    * Do stats without a Windows machine 

Where we're going:

This is a project that could use some work. If you like to code and like to play quiz bowl, this could use some improvements, like:

    * A way to cleanly export a tournament and make its results static
    * A way to create new tournaments or divisions of a tournament without doing anything at the command-line
    * Something like a round-robin and bracket generator, so that qbsql could know what matches should be played, and to make tournament directors' lives easier.
    * Probably lots more!

** How to install and use qbsql **
**********************************

Installation

   1. Download the code from the Downloads section and unzip it somewhere accessible by your webserver.
   2. Edit the file functions.php as necessary. For now, the important thing is $mysql_prefix. Set it to something short that will represent this tournament. For example, for an intramural tournament, you might choose im2008. Also set the appropriate variables to match your MySQL configuration.
   3. Edit the file structure.sql, changing each instance of im1 in the file (like im1_players) to the prefix you chose in step 2 (i.e., im2008_players). Use your text editor's find and replace function.
   4. Import structure.sql into your MySQL database, using a command like:

      mysql -u my_username -p my_password my_database < structure.sql

   5. You should be ready to go. Pull up the page index.php in your web browser. Enter the username and password from functions.php into the two boxes and you can start running the tournament! 

Running a Tournament

   1. Create teams
